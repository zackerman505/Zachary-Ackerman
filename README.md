Hi, my name is Zack Ackerman I'm aspiring to be new business anlyst preferrably in the financial or consulting sector. I'm currently able to pinpoint information using SQL, create data visualisations through story telling and Power BI, as well as using Python to extract data. I'm eager to start leveraging these tools out in the worl of business!



Currently, I'm a field manager at Orkin Pest Control looking to expand my potential to other focuses such as business analytics. I recently graduated a 4-month bootcamp with Triple Ten's Business Intelligeence Analyst program. Here we developed our skills to properly manipulate and clean data sets,create data visuals to present our finding throughout the analysis(Tableau and Power Bi), pinpoint different information from tables(SQL or Python) and cross examine data using various searches such as VlookUp in Google sheets or Excel. 



Fun facts about myself:
-I love to workout and power lift, as I played various sports throughout highschool.üèã
-I'm part of a recreational beach volleyball in Fort Lauderdale üèê
-I'm a very big into classic watches, I beleiev they're far classier
-I'm big into business events and social groups
